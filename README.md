Nao-Programs:

This is a compilation of programs used to communicate with Nao using a server on Python 3 and a client on Python 2.

Using client6.py, server6.py, and the .png files, the program takes an image and attempts to play a round of rock-paper-scissors.
The rock-paper-scissors.py file, as well as the .png files, were taken from https://www.computervision.zone/courses/rock-paper-scissor/

showImage.py is a modification of getImage from http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/dev/python/examples/vision/get_image.html.
It will take a picture and check for faces. It will then draw a box around the face and have Nao say a message.
